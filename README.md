# Connect-Four
My third game made in Javascript, basic game which only checks x and y axis or rows and columns for chain of four connected tokens but I intend to make it possible to also check in diagonal directions. Game includes gravity so you can place tokens only on lowst possible places, falling animations and available spaces markers coming soon.
